`<seg type = "Investigar filosofía">`
   `<dur>`min. 5:40-11:40`</dur>`
`<u>``<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: La labor fundamental del `<placeName type = "Universidad">`instituto es la investigación`</placeName>`. Es la investigación en filosofía, y a veces quizá para el público en general es difícil entender en qué consiste investigar filosofía.
Te habrá pasado a ti seguramente, a todos nos pasa a los que trabajamos en el instituto los que nos dedicamos
a la investigación en filosofía que un vecino en el autobús o este… un conocido le preguntan: ¿bueno y tú
qué haces?, tú respondes bueno investigo filosofía y la respuesta, `<incident>` o sea`</incident>`, los deja en blanco.
Investigar filosofía significa sobre todo ocuparse de una manera personal individual, pero también de
manera colectiva de una serie de temas y problemas que se han ido gestando a lo largo de una tradición
milenaria. La tradición filosófica es quizá la tradición epistémica, intelectual más antigua de occidente;
entonces eso supone el dominio de una serie de técnicas de métodos, el conocimiento de una serie de autores
y de libros fundamentales que son muy amplios, son muy vastos y eso requiere una concentración y un
trabajo muy específicos. Entonces el instituto está aquí para que cierto grupo de profesores universitarios
puedan dedicarse de tiempo completo a la investigación. Esto fue el ideal originario de la formación del
instituto un ideal que fue planteado por `<persName type = "colega filósofo">`Eduardo García Máynez`</persName>` a mediados del siglo pasado y que pues afortunadamente hoy en día es posible llevar a cabo ese sueño que tenía García Máynez de que pueda haber
universitarios que se dediquen primordialmente a la investigación en filosofía; sin embargo, en el instituto
los investigadores no sólo investigan filosofía, sino que tienen una actividad docente muy intensa. Todos
los investigadores del instituto son también profesores a nivel universitario, primordialmente en la facultad
de filosofía y letras, pero también en algunos otros lugares y la tercera función fundamental del instituto es
la difusión y la extensión del pensamiento filosófico, y es ahí en donde yo creo que hemos fallado un poco
con aquellas personas que les preguntan sobre investigaciones filosóficas y no han oído hablar de él. Este
es un reto que tenemos`</u>`. 
`<u>``<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Sí, este reto proviene no sólo del público en general, sino inclusive de
investigar de investigadores en otras áreas de la cultura y del saber. No sé si estás de acuerdo conmigo, pero
a mí me parece obvio que mientras más intensa sea la interacción entre la investigación filosófica y las
investigaciones de punta en distintas áreas de la ciencia: la vida política, la vida cultural, pues es mucho
más positivo para la sociedad en su conjunto. Podríamos decir inclusive que la filosofía… es difícil saber
en qué consiste la investigación filosófica pero que cuando ésta no se da, se resiente, y quizá un caso un
caso concreto de esto sería el debate político en méxico: el hecho de que haya habido poca filosofía política
seria en nuestro país ha dejado un hueco que ha sido ocupado por periodistas, por gente que improvisa y
gente que no tiene las herramientas suficientes para realizar análisis interesantes, importantes en el área de
la política y que es parte de nuestras funciones realizar. Hay hay alguna gente, algunas personas que se han
abocado a este tipo de temas y más recientemente que en otros en otras épocas, pero en general esto ha
pasado y así como ha pasado en el área de la filosofía política, ha pasado en otras áreas; entonces parte de
la función del instituto sería la de reactivar está este trabajo de coordinación con las investigaciones y los
problemas que nos agobian en todos los en todos los ámbitos, ¿no? `</u>`.
`<u>``<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Exactamente, `<incident>` o sea `</incident>`, `<seg type="Concepción general de la filsofía">`la filosofía se ocupa de todas las cuestiones importantes del ser humano; desde problemas personales, existenciales, teológicos, morales.. que tienen que ver con la decisión personal la qué voy a hacer en este momento con respecto a esta cuestión… hasta cuestiones mucho más amplias de
políticas sociales globales, mundiales y sí, `<incident>` o sea`</incident>`, la la filosofía tiene que estar presente. La filosofía no
puede estar encerrada en un cubículo, en cuatro paredes porque no sería como traicionar al espíritu
originario de los grandes filósofos. `<incident>` O sea`</incident>`, Sócrates, este.. salía a la calle, en la polis, a dialogar, a increpar,
a interactuar. Era un personaje a veces es difícil, ¿no? `</u>`
`<u>``<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Incómodo seguramente.`</u>`
`<u>``<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Incómodo… este… pero crítico: el filósofo tiene que tener una actitud crítica, eso es fundamental y sí,
estoy de acuerdo contigo… México necesita de la filosofía como cualquier otra sociedad, porque la
sociedad misma pide en muchas ocasiones… constantemente, reflexiones de naturaleza filosófica, sobre
los problemas que la están aquejando `</seg>` `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Y bueno precisamente en a mí me parece que una forma auténtica de valorar la filosofía y de hacerle
apreciar por otras personas es, no tanto discutiendo sobre lo que es la filosofía o lo que no es, sino
adentrándose en problemas concretos.`</u>` `</seg>`.

`<seg type = "Labor del Instituto de Investigaciones Filosóficas, Filosofía analítica">`
   `<dur>` min. 20-25:22`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: En el `<placeName type = "Universidad">`instituto de investigaciones filosóficas`</placeName>`, desde su fundación, hemos tratado de defender y de generar crear una filosofía que tenga aspiraciones teóricas, sistemáticas y una de las modalidades de esta visión muy general de la filosofía es lo que se conoce como filosofía analítica. Eeeh… el instituto se le
conoce en `<placeName type ="país donde se hace filosofía">`México`</placeName>` y en el resto del mundo como un lugar en donde se ha cultivado esta concepción de la filosofía que es la filosofía, que es una filosofía que busca el rigor, la claridad en el discurso la exactitud en
los conceptos, la argumentación, el análisis… y en esto se asemeja al trabajo científico, que es un trabajo
riguroso, metódico, cuidadoso sistemático, también… ese es el tipo de filosofía que hemos tratado de hacer
el instituto, de desarrollar y quizá a veces por eso, me atrevería está a a lanzar esta hipótesis, el trabajo que
se hace en el instituto, puede resultar algunas personas algo como distante o lejano de lo que a veces se
entiende por filosofía, que es una reflexión a veces más ligada a cierto tipo de recursos estilísticos o del
periodismo o del ensayo, del discurso semi religioso, semi poético a las intuiciones, a las corazonadas,
este… a ese tipo de cosas, ¿no?, pero este este tipo de filosofía que se hace el instituto, bueno sí es resultado,
yo diría, de un proceso largo, ¿no? Este… muy sólido en la filosofía mexicana del siglo XX, o sea, no
llegamos allí de casualidad, sino que fue todo un proceso de profesionalización, sobre todo, del trabajo
filosófico que se hacía en México; para pasar del discurso semi-literario, de este de inspiración, del
arrebato… para pasar a un trabajo muy profesional, muy serio, que es lo que tratamos de hacer `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Más técnico `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Exactamente, técnico `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Digamos que podemos en generar hablar de una filosofía blanda, una filosofía de improvisación, casi
acercándonos a lo bohemio y la filosofía profesional, seria, que aspira a tener el mismo grado de rigor que
cualquier disciplina científica, en donde hay resultados que son públicos: compartibles o no, refutables o
no, de manera objetiva y que pretende proporcionar claridad respecto a muchos temas de un modo que sea
convincente y definitivo en la medida de lo posible `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Exactamente. Sí, `<incident>` o sea`</incident>` , así como algunos dicen que hay literatura light y literatura sólida… nosotros… la aspiración en el instituto ha sido hacer una filosofía sólida `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Esta filosofía sólida, como la llamas, tiene que estar vinculada también a las actividades desarrolladas
por otros colegas digamos universitarios y no sólo… podemos hablar de filosofía de la ciencia, la filosofía
de la religión, filosofía política…. en estos casos por ejemplo y filosofía y la ciencia qué importancia le
concedes tú… nosotros tenemos en el instituto un posgrado de filosofía de la ciencia y esa es una rama muy
importante en la filosofía mexicana, y para la labor interdisciplinaria que también estamos tratando de
realizar `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Sí, por supuesto, y es una este es algo que esta preocupación para la filosofía la ciencia pues nos viene
desde muy lejos, ¿no? Piensa por ejemplo en el el positivismo de finales de XIX que sostenía que la filosofía
tiene que estar muy orientada hacia la ciencia… no sé las ciencias naturales, la física, las matemáticas, todo
eso. `<incident>` O sea`</incident>` que sí, este… en México ahí hay una larga tradición de cultivo de la la filosofía la ciencia;
tenemos un posgrado en filosofía de la ciencia que ya tiene unos 20 años han salido ya varias generaciones
de egresados de ese posgrado, Es unn posgrado que tiene el instituto, conjuntamente con la facultad de
filosofía y letras, y en unos cuantos meses, una muy buena noticia, la facultad de ciencias también se va a
incorporar al programa de la maestría del doctorado en filosofía y la ciencia. `<incident>` O sea`</incident>`  que se está conformando
una comunidad de investigadores, que hacen trabajo `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >` filosófico multi e interdisciplinario, con científicos y sobre todo de la `<placeName type = "Universidad">`UNAM `</placeName>`y en las ramas muy diversas… filosofía de la biología, filosofía de las matemáticas,
ciencias cognitivas`</rs>`…`</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Bueno, Guillermo, vamos a una pausa muy breve y retomamos ahorita nuestra conversación.`</u>` `</seg>`.

`<seg type = "Interconexión filosófica">`
   `<dur>`min. 49:08-50:51`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: `<seg type="Filosofía práctica, conexión de la filosofía con otras áreas">` Entonces… esta curiosidad del filósofo, pues hace que uno vaya tocando temas distintos, y lo que es
maravilloso de la filosofía es que los temas se van conectando… como si tuvieras un mapa de estos mapas
de sistemas ferroviarios así este en Europa donde un puntito una vía te lleva a otra y luego otra metro y asó
podrías hacer como múltiples viajes… circuitos </u>.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: El carácter interconectado de los problemas filosóficos.`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Entonces… éste pues sí, visto así es una manera muy optimista de ponerlo… porque la filosofía tiene
tiene también sus momentos difíciles… la filosofía es como un `<emph type="metáfora de la filosofía como viaje">`viaje`</emph>`, un viaje que uno va tomando así como si uno se pusiera la mochila y va recorriendo… este… distintos lugares`</seg>` `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Hay quien no se sale de la estación.`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`GH`</speaker>`: Exactamente, hay quien no sale la estación… pero pues sí, sabes esta idea de siguiendo… si me
permites seguir con esta idea de la filosofía como un viaje… Yo creo que puede darnos una idea de, de este
sentimiento de constante aventura y descubrimiento que se tiene. Quizá puede decirse, así como algunos
nunca salen de la estación, el problema con la filosofía es que nunca llega a una estación final. Entonces
esta sensación de que uno va viajando viajando viajando y no toca piso, el viaje no termina; y eso puede
ser a veces desesperante, frustrante, incluso angustiante, pero yo creo que el carácter del filósofo requiere…
este… tener la capacidad de estar en este viaje permanente que es una aventura del del intelecto; quizá
suena muy presuntuoso... `</u>` `</seg>`

   `<dur>`min. 2:18-3:36.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Y, bueno, quería yo retomar este, este este primer enigma que me plantea esta situación de que estés
trabajando tú en ingeniería porque no me queda en lo más mínimo claro qué tiene que ver la ingeniería con
la filosofía… ¿Por qué estás allí trabajando como filósofa, digamos? `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`NL`</speaker>`: Bueno, la verdad es que la la idea de que haya un filósofo o gente de filosofía
trabajando en ingeniería es por anomalía… lo ideal es que no sea la ingeniería haga, si estuviera sana,
estuviera haciendo su trabajo independientemente de la filosofía, pero las ciencias de la computación han
generado que el ingeniero de repente tenga que estar discutiendo problemas de de carácter netamente
filosófico, y está muy enredado en el problema mente y cuerpo `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: ¿Los problemas filosóficos, en tu opinión, pueden detener o desorientar la investigación empírica? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`NL`</speaker>`: La tecnología la detiene. `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (Choque de posturas y conexión entre ellas)">`
   `<dur>`min. 18:58-19:53`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AE`</speaker>`(Dirigiéndose a AT): Bueno, de hecho es interesante porque en mi clase de
teoría del conocimiento en la facultad yo doy tu libro a mis estudiantes para que lo lean sí sí y es muy
interesante porque, en efecto, tú tienes un argumento de este tipo para afirmar que las creencias no pueden
ser estados mentales, y entonces yo siempre me peleo con mis estudiantes para que no te crean.. porque yo
digo: en efecto hay un fuerte argumento, que es el que tú esgrimes ahí con mucho más cuidado y que bueno
sí sería bueno irlo a ver a tu libro… este, pero lo que yo creo es: ¿si no son estados mentales las creencias
qué son?, o sea qué respuesta más plausible y más verosímil tenemos a la pregunta de qué es una creencia…
o sea, si tú me la das.. órale, digamos, que el argumento… yo tengo la carga de la prueba, pero si tú no me
das una mejor explicación, entonces, ¿por qué habría yo de creer que esto no es correcto? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: `<link target="Anterior párrafo antes de alternacia" type="Postura diferente de AT con respecto a AE">` Pero yo creo que sí hay explicaciones alternativas…`</link>` `</u>` `</seg>`.


`<seg type = "Parte 3: (Conexión entre filosofía y ciencias cognitivas)">`
   `<dur>`min. 23-27`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`NL`</speaker>`: Yo veo que hay dos plataformas muy claras, que además no se juntan, curiosamente: una es la que
viene de la línea cartesiana, que es la que está influenciando todavía, y severamente, a las ciencias cognitivas
y que las va a estar deteniendo porque en realidad esa teoría, la teoría cartesiana, es una teoría que quieres
para allá y te detiene, y para allá y te detiene... todo está lleno de absurdo, yo no sé cómo lo quieren las
gentes, la verdad es lo que me parece horrible. Pero tienes otra plataforma que yo lo llamaría la
wittgenstaniana… la que está con análisis gramatical, que está enseñando que muchas cosas que te generan
problemas simple y sencillamente son incomprensiones conceptuales.
Ahora…¿qué es lo que está pasando que por qué no se juntan estas dos plataformas? Porque la
wittgenstaniana no te genera teorías y lo que está buscando el cognitiva es teorías sobre cosas que no son
teorizables `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`AE`</speaker>`: Ahí a mí me parece muy difícil decir que hay cosas que… ¿en qué sentido podría uno decir por ejemplo
que él pensando? Digo ante esos `<persName type="Filósofo en inglés">`Fodor`</persName>`, ¿no? No podemos decir nada, no podemos tener ningún
conocimiento acerca de cómo funciona el pensar… porque Fodor, claro, hace esta distinción entre una cosa
son los sistemas perceptivos y lo que él llama los sistemas periféricos y el lenguaje probablemente, sobre
el que podemos tener una teoría, de hecho el apela a `<persName type="Filósofo en inglés, linguista">`Chomsky`</persName>`como una… la teoría más verosímil que tenemos. Entonces bueno esa parte de la cabeza digamos donde el funcionamiento cognitivo lo podemos
describir más o menos bien, a través de teorías computacionales de la mente. El resto, no tenemos ni la
menor idea y no podemos tener ni la menor idea… yo creo que como decir “sí, está bien”, y entonces
sigamos… ¿Por qué?, digo, la pregunta natural es por qué no lo podemos… en todo caso, si de veras no se
puede teorizar, necesitamos una respuesta a la pregunta de por qué no podemos teorizar acerca de ello, y
yo creo que eso es parte de lo que se trata... si de verdad no lo podemos hacer: ¿Por qué no lo podemos
hacer?, y eso te va a arrojar luz sobre qué es el pensamiento`</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`NL`</speaker>`: Esos términos psicológicos tienen una característica, no tienen un solo uso. Parte de su estructura y de
su riqueza es que en distintas circunstancias tú usas el mismo ruido, digamos, para describir distintas
situaciones… el pensamiento es una de ellas curiosamente. O sea, yo creo que es una de las cosas que tienen
un abanico impresionante de utilizaciones. Entonces cuando alguien me dice, desde las ciencias cognitivas:
“quiero saber qué es el pensamiento”, perdóname, pero ya te metiste en un lío espantoso `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AE`</speaker>`: No claro, pero esto es parte de nuestro trabajo como filósofos que nos acercamos a las ciencias
cognitivas. El trabajo conceptual, ¿no? Simplemente lo que yo digo es: no es posible decir que que no es
posible teorizar sobre un fenómeno justamente si no sabemos ni qué es… entonces, ¿De qué se trata o qué
hacemos los filósofos cuando nos acercamos a las ciencias cognitivas? Tratar de esclarecer estos
conceptos… no creo que haya algo terminado, es un trabajo largo, pero por ejemplo empezamos a tener
como cosas más claras respecto… sí, pensamiento es una cosa muy grande, pero por ejemplo empezamos
a hablar por ejemplo de razonamiento, una distinción entre razonamiento reflexivo y razonamiento
reflectivo le llaman, lo que simplemente es como por reflejo y el otro sí requiere mucho mayor capacidad
cognitiva para descontextualizar los problemas, para utilizar ciertas reglas tratas, etcétera. Entonces este
tipo de distinciones donde dices: bueno, una cosa es una inferencia que requiere la utilización de reglas
abstractas y otra es una una inferencia que puede llevar a cabo utilizando solo reglas heurísticas que se
llaman… y ahí hay mucho trabajo por ejemplo en `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >` psicología cognitiva, psicología el razonamiento psicología cognitiva `</rs>` `</u>` `</seg>`.

`<seg type = "Parte 4: (Cierre)">`
   `<dur>` min. 53:09-56`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Bueno, tenemos que este terminar el programa en algún momento, desafortunadamente. ¿Cómo
sintetizarías tú tupunto de vista, el interés actual en las ciencias cognitivas a pesar de los problemas que se
les pueden ir planteando permanentemente? Adelante `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`NL`</speaker>`: Me quedo un poco desconcertada… o sea, yo he trabajado, sobre todo de la línea de modelos
computacionales, inspirados en sistemas biológicos, mucho lo que son ciencias cognitivas, pero ahorita me
diste la sensación de que ya es un título sin contenido `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AE`</speaker>`: `<link target="desacuerdo con respecto al NL, en el cambio anterior" type="postura de AE">` No creo que sea tanto así como que… yo creo que la idea esta de que podemos de algún modo modelar
la mente a través de un moldelos computacionales sigue siendo vigente, sigue siendo uno de los objetivos
que se buscan alcanzar, pero yo creo que en efecto hay discusiones mucho más ricas hoy día, ¿no?, y yo
creo que algo de lo que a mí me resulta muy interesante de las ciencias cognitivas, es que sí son
acercamientos como desde muchas disciplinas a problemas que de algún modo nos atañen a todos. Esta
idea vieja de que había una clara separación entre disciplinas empíricas y normativas, conceptuales o como
quieran llamarles, como que las ciencias cognitivas permiten que se borre, y eso a mí me resulta muy
interesante `</link>` `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: `<link target="desacuerdo con respecto a la supuesta postura anterior, enunciada por AE" type="Postura de AT">`No tenemos que terminar en debates de... sobre gustos filosóficos, porque eso es precisamente lo que
a mí me parece un retroceso en filosofía. Esta esta idea de que la filosofía es una especie de prolongación
de la ciencia o anticipación de la ciencia que produce…`</link>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AE`</speaker>`: Pero siempre pones palabras en mi boca que no son… prolongación o anticipación no `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Es la versión russeliana, quineana de la ciencia y de la filosofía como la vanguardia, de la vanguardia
del conocimiento, entonces, bueno, digo esto es una concepción, hay otras alternativas. No sé, Nydia… un
par de palabras para terminar `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`NL`</speaker>`: `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` Sí, yo, este, creo que coincido contigo en un aspecto… o sea disciplinas que nunca se habían acercado una a la otra, efectivamente a través de las ciencias cognitivas empezó al acercamiento; también por eso, de alguna manera, no es tan extraño que haya un filósofo en la `<placeName type = "Universidad">`facultad de `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">`ingeniería`</placeName>`… se da una explicaciónde por qué puede haber filósofos en biología, puede haber filósofos en otras áreas. Esto sí es una de las cosas en las que contribuyó las ciencias cognitivas. Lástima que se fundamentó en una premisa errónea, y yo creo que mi trabajo por ejemplo consiste justamente en tratar de ver de qué manera, por ejemplo, en un
caso muy específico, los ingenieros no deben de necesitar de filósofos, ya es un error que estén cayendo en
problemas filosóficos y ese error también se lo hereda las ciencias cognitivas `</rs>` `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`.

`<u>` `<speaker>`FC`</speaker>`: (…) De ahí se define incluso un área que se llama `<emph type="Tema recurrente del corpus: Inteligencia Artificial (IA)">` inteligencia artificial`</emph>`, en donde el objetivo es construir máquinas que desplieguen comportamientos, que cuando los vemos en los seres vivos, aceptamos que requieren de inteligencia, y este... entonces en realidad se vuelve un problema,
porque actualmente la etiqueta de inteligencia artificial es algo que ya es casi, pues como… como que nos
falló, y me da la impresión de que... `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: `<term type = "Interdisciplina de la filosofía, conexión con otras áreas">` En la raíz lo que había era un problema filosófico `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`FC`</speaker>` Filosófico del lenguaje. O… ¿como lo ves? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Yo sí lo veo de esta manera, es decir, muchas investigaciones científicas, por muy entusiastas que y
que sean los científicos en el momento en que se inician, porque hay como grandes promesas ahí, resulta
que están desencaminadas y terminan en fracasos porque hay en la raíz algún problema filosófico que no
quedó, no solamente resuelto, sino ni siquiera ha vislumbrado… vamos a tomar el caso del pensamiento:
Turing construye una máquina que puede responder a cierta clase de inputs y se mueve de cierta manera o
no, y avanza de cierto modo, y podemos construir esto y complicarlo, de modo que le damos una orden,
responde etc. Dicen, bueno, este es un ejemplo de lo que es pensar, porque nosotros así razonamos.
Diremos, bueno, espérame… es que pensar en español quiere decir muchísimas más cosas: yo pienso, por
ejemplo, en lo que desayune ayer, pienso en un problema que no es resuelto con mi coche, pienso en el
examen de los alumnos; o sea, tú te fijaste en una aplicación del verbo pensar que fue la que más te llamó
la atención y construiste… desarrollaste una investigación empírica concreta en relación con eso, pero
pensar cubre muchísimas más cosas. Entonces si tú lo que querías era darnos la esencia del pensar y por lo
tanto de las actividades mentales o de los procesos mentales, no estás muy lejos de la marca porque… es
decir, de la inteligencia. Ese es un buen, ese es un buen caso: el caso de la inteligencia. Uno de los filósofos
analíticos más importantes que ha habido es `<persName type = "Filósofo en inglés">` Gilbert Ryle`</persName>`. Ryle escribió un un libro muy importante y muy interesante, muy ameno, y traducido al español… traducido como `<q type="Obras citadas">`“El concepto de lo mental” `</q>`, este… en en inglés es “Concept of mind”, pero no podemos decir el concepto, este… “El concepto de mente”, porque
sería… equívoco. Entonces lo tradujeron como “El concepto de lo mental”; ahí hay una sección dedicada
presente a la inteligencia: entonces la pregunta no es si la inteligencia es una propiedad de algún sector del
cerebro si éste… la destila, como diría `<persName type= "Filósofo en inglés, linguista">`Chomsky`</persName>`, ¿no? si no, bueno, vamos a ver cuándo decimos y en qué circunstancias decimos de alguien que es inteligente porque juega bien ajedrez y gana, es inteligente porque
resuelve dificultades en el trabajo, es inteligente porque sale adelante en problemas caseros… o sea, resulta
que el concepto de inteligencia es un concepto paraguas que sirve para hablar de conducta y nunca fue
usado para hablar de propiedades internas, al contrario: la inteligencia es algo que se ve, que se expresa en
la conducta, entonces, como queremos distinguir lo mental de lo físico, y entonces decimos que la
inteligencia no es algo físico, ¿verdad?, no es como una mano fuerte… no es eso. Es algo mental, entonces
tiene que ser interno, entonces nos desligamos de la conducta y nos desviamos… y entonces puede haber
investigaciones científicas, en torno a la inteligencia que de entrada sabemos que no van a conducir a nada,
por un error filosófico que está en la raíz… por un prejuicio, o una interpretación fácil, del modo cómo
opera la palabra inteligencia `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>`.

`<u>` `<speaker>`AT`</speaker>`: Bueno, `<seg type = "Concepción general de la filosofía">` la filosofía se ha convertido en una disciplina muy técnica, difícil, de hecho, no sé si lo dije bien… porque siempre fue difícil, la buena filosofía siempre fue difícil para la gente de la época. Entonces es una clase de estudios muy diferente de la clase de estudios que se realizan en ciencia, es una disciplina
que tiene un efecto en nuestras vidas de un modo muy peculiar, porque las transforma; exige mucho de
nosotros, o de las personas que están, digamos, genuinamente interesadas en la filosofía; es una es una…
una rama de la cultura que requiere de muchos estudios previos… desde luego que no se debe, a mi modo
de ver, se puede, pero no se debe estudiar filosofía y olvidarse de los clásicos y de los antecesores: hay
siempre que leer a sus clásicos, tenerlos presentes, tenerlos vivos, son siempre refrescantes… hay que
estudiar lógica, hay que enterarse de distintas facetas de la ciencia, tener algunas alguna visión de lo que es
el mundo científico, y luego entender que el estudio en filosofía vuelve a la gente crítica, vuelve a la gente
incómoda en el buen sentido de la expresión, y esto es lo que hace avanzar el pensamiento `</seg>` `</u>`.

`<seg type = "Parte 1: David Hume's life">`
   `<dur>`min. 4:20:08-4:23`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: The philosopher most widely regarded as the greatest who has ever written in the english
language is David Hume. Not an englishman but a scot, born in Edinburgh in the year 1711. He did some
of his best work very young, at about 18 he experienced a sort of intellectual revelation and over the next
eight years he produced a large and revolutionary book called `<q type="Obras citadas">`“A Teatreatise of Human Nature”`</q>`, it met
with little attention, and even less understanding; in his own phrase, it fell dead born from the press. So, in
his thirties, he tried to rewrite that book in what, he hoped, would be a more popular form. This resulted in
two smaller volumes, one called `<q type="Obras citadas">`“An inquiry concerning human understanding”`</q>`,  and one called “An inquiry
concerning the principles of morals”; but these were scarcely any better received and he gave the
impression, then, of turning away from philosophy.
`<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">`
In his forties he wrote a history of Great Britain, which for a hundred years was the standard work; that's
why he still sometimes categorized in libraries and books of reference as: David Hume, `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >`
historian`</rs>`.
In his own lifetime he made his reputation too as an `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >`economist `</rs>` and his monetary theories have been reattracting attention recently; he was even, in a modest way, a man of affairs: in the war of the austrian
succession, he served as a staff officer on two military expeditions, and, for a couple of years, in his early
fifties, he was secretary to the british embassy in Paris, and then, after that, under secretary of state in
London.`</term>`
In all the many different circles in which he moved he was popular for his good nature as much as for his
genius, such was his gift for friendship that he almost brought off the impossible task of befriending his
french contemporary philosopher Rousseau, who at one time actually proposed making his home in Britain,
because Hume was there. In France, Hume was known as le bon David, and in his native Edinburgh the
street in which he lived was and is named after him: “Saint David Street”; in view of the latter point it's
perhaps ironical that in secret he'd been writing his final philosophical masterpiece, a profound and
damaging critique of natural religion which didn't come to light until after his death.
He died in 1776 and in 1779 his dialogues concerning natural religion were published; some people consider
it his best work, He's an unusually attractive figure, who should also be seen as part of that great flowering
of intellectual life in Edinburgh in the 18th century, which we now refer to as “the scottish enlightenment”.
In David Hume, `<persName type = "economista">` Adam Smith`</persName>`, and James Boswell, the scottish enlightenment produced the english
language's foremost philosopher, economistm and biographer; and they all knew each other Adam Smith
was one of Hume's closest friends and was greatly influenced by him `</u>` `</seg>`.

`<seg type = "Parte 2: : Scientific Philosophy">`
   `<dur>`min. 4:32:20-4:35:25.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: (…) He [Hume] describes his Treatise as “an attempt to introduce the experimental method of
reasoning into moral subjects”. Was he trying to make philosophy scientific? Was that his idea? `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`JP`</speaker>`: `<seg type="Interdisciplina de la filosofía, relación con otras áreas">` Well, moral subjects… of course, he intended very broadly, he would have included everything we now call `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >`politics, he would have included anything we would call psychology, and as well as anything we would call moral philosophy`</rs>`; and he did want to make these more scientific, in a certain sense, than they had ever been. What he says is that when you approach these subjects you find that people
who usually talk seriously and take evidence into account, start making wild statements without any real
evidence; they start preaching at us, rather than telling us what things are like, they lay down laws for us
rather than looking at the facts and that we ought to look at the facts, in respect to political life and human
affairs, just as we do in the natural sciences `</seg>` `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: There's an implied theory of language and meaning, isn't there?, in this approach that we are now
talking about, because he very definitely thought that in order to… for a word to mean anything at all it had
to relate to a specific idea, and for an idea to have real content it had to be derived from experience; so, in
effect, Hume is saying: “if you want to know what a word means look for the experience from which it's
derived, if you can't find an experience or an observation from which it derives then it doesn't mean
anything”. So there's this whole theory of meaning, is there not?, underlying the philosophical approach
that you've just been outlining `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`JP`</speaker>`:Yes, he draws distinction… he's very keen on this, although he doesn't mention it specifically very
often, between talking and thinking… we're thinking only when we're operating with clear ideas which
have a real source in experience, but he suggests that, much of the time, we're talking away and we're using
what are really completely confused notions, which have no real foundation in experience; if he looked at
our contemporary political life, and our contemporary talk he'd find, I think, that it was full of notions which
people use completely irreflectively. If you ask what the foundation and experience was of, let's say, ideas
like social justice or ideas like accountability, you might find it extremely difficult to see what the actual
factual situation was that these were referring to… what they concretely mean, and one of his main points
is we should look and see what things concretely mean… you'd be absolutely horrified by much of what
now passes for literary criticism, for example, that was something he was very interested in, but he thought
he had to relate it very concretely to literature and now it becomes so much of a rather bad philosophy, full
of expressions, which Hume, I think, would very rapidly show have no meaning in his theory of meaning `</u>` `</seg>`.

`<seg type = "Parte 3: Hume and Quantum Mechanics">`
   `<dur>`min. 4:46:50-4:47:50.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: When one looks at Hume, from the standpoint of our time, I think one is very struck by the sort of
modernity, from our point of view, of very much of it… I mean, he was centrally concerned with this
problem of the self: well, some of the best philosophy that's been done in Britain in recent years has been
about problems of the self. Scientists in the 20th century have been deeply puzzled, especially in their
thinking about `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">`quantum physics`</rs>`, about the presence or absence of causal connection… and only yesterday, `<incident>`so to speak`</incident>`, the logical positivists, or at least the chief representative of logical positivism in the englishs-peaking world, A.J. Ayer, `<seg type="Influencia de Hume">`were constantly talking about how much they owed to Hume and how almost
everything they'd heir… is constantly saying that almost everything he has to say has previously been said
by Hume `</seg>` `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

OUTSIDE PHILOSOPHY)">`
   `<dur>`min. 10:35:30-10:36:30`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`JS`</speaker>`: `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` He [Wittgenstein] has not been adequately understood in philosophy, but some of these fields are literary criticism and aesthetics… generally, Wittgenstein is now often referred to, and I think will become more influential, um… there is a great deal of mention of Wittgenstein in social sciences,
particularly `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">`anthropology, because he thought of himself as doing a kind of anthropology. There is a book written about the importance of Wittgenstein for political theory `</rs>`… so it's what… the french would call “the
sciences of man” that Wittgenstein has been most influential, paradoxically in a way, because he wrote so
much about the philosophy of mathematics, but most of his influences now are in outside of philosophy;
are in the social sciences `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (Wittgenstein’s contribution, AI)">`
   `<dur>`min. 10:42:22-10:43:26.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`JS`</speaker>`: However, the most powerful part of Wittgenstein, from my own personal point of view, is not his work
in the philosophy of language and mind, but it's an idea that really begins to acquire momentum in his last
work, it also appears in his earlier work, but in his very last work that he wrote when he was dying, on
certainty, and that's it's a rather subtle idea but it's this: We have, in the western intellectual tradition, going
back to Plato… we have the idea that any meaningful human behavior must somehow be the expression of
a theory, an implicit theory that we hold, that if you understand me, and i understand you, it can only
because we each have a theory of the other.`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: As you say, an implicit theory.`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`JS`</speaker>` An implicit theory. `<persName type = "Filósofo en inglés, linguista" >`Chomsky`</persName>` thinks this: that there's an unconscious theory of language, and `<emph type="Tema recurrente del corpus: Inteligencia Artificial (IA)">`Artificial Intelligence `</emph>` is based on this presupposition, that there are these… unconscious theories. Now, there's some truth in that, but Wittgenstein is anxious to emphasize that a great deal of what we do both is both socially and biologically primitive, it's a way of responding, it's a way of acting, we just act, we don't need to appeal to the idea that there's some implicit theoretical structure that enables us to act `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 1: (Turing and philosophy, language, etcétera.)">`
   `<dur>`min. 2:15-5:20.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DH`</speaker>`: Yeah, the Turing test, of course, it's been unbelievably influential and `<persName type= "filósofo, matemático, computólogo">`Turing `</persName>` is oneof my all-time heroes, but `<term type= "la filosofía es fundamental para las demás áreas">` I think… if you look back at the `<q type="Obras citadas">` 1950 paper, original paper`</q>`, and read the original, you'll see… I don't think he meant it to be a rigorous formal test, I think it was more like a thought experiment, almost a bit of philosophy, he was writing `</term>`. `<term type ="Opinión sobre la filosofía de un no filósofo tradicional">` If you look at the style of the paper, and you cansee he didn't specify it very rigorously; so, for example, he didn't specify the knowledge that the expert or judge would have. `<incident>`Um`</incident>`... not either, you know, how much time would they have to investigate this. So,
these are important parameters if you were gonna make it... uh, a true sort of formal test. Um… and, you
know, some… by some measures, people claimed the `<emph>`Turing test`</emph>` passed… several, you know, a decade
ago I remember someone claiming that with a kind of very bog standard normal… Uh, logic model... um,
because they pretended it was a it was a kid; so the the judges thought that the machine, you know, was
was a… was a child. So, um… that would be very different from an expert `<emph>`AI`</emph>` person… uh, interrogating a
machine and knowing how it was built and so on. So I think, `<incident>`um, you know`</incident>`, we should probably move
away from that as a formal test and move more towards a general test where we test the AI capabilities on
a range of tasks and see if it reaches human level or above performance on, maybe thousands, perhaps even
millions of tasks eventually, and cover the entire sort of cognitive space. So I think, for its time, it was an
amazing thought experiment and also 1950s obviously it was barely the dawn of the computer age. So, of
course, he only thought about text, and now… `<incident>`um`</incident>`, we have a lot more different inputs `</term>` `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: So yeah… maybe the better thing to test is the generalizability so across multiple tasks,
but I think it's also possible as… as systems like God show that eventually that might… map right back to
language, so you might be able to demonstrate your ability to generalize across tasks, by then
communicating your ability to generalize across tasks, which is kind of what we do through conversation
anyway, when we jump around, ultimately what's in there, in that conversation, is not just you moving
around knowledge, it's you moving around like these entirely different modalities of understanding that
ultimately map to your ability to… to, uh, operate successfully in all these domains, which you can think
of as tasks `</u>`. 
 `<u>` `<speaker>`DH`</speaker>`: Yeah, `<term type = "idea filosófica de un no filósofo tradicional">`I think, certainly, we as humans use language as our main generalization-communication tool so i think we end up thinking in language and expressing our solutions in language `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>`. 

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (Conscious AI and agency, Philosophy)">`
   `<dur>`min. 1:43:00-1:48:10`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: Have you ever met a language model that's sentient? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DH`</speaker>`: No, I no…no `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: What do you make of the case of when you kind of feel that there's some elements of sentience to this
system? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DH`</speaker>`: Yeah, so this is, you know, an interesting question and… `<incident>`uh, uh`</incident>`, obviously a very fundamental one, so first thing to say is, I think, that none of the systems we have today… I would say even have one iota
of… `<incident>`uh`</incident>`, semblance of consciousness or sentience. That's my personal feeling interacting with them every
day; so I think that's way premature to be discussing what that engineer talked about. I appreciate, I think,
at the moment, it's more of a projection of the way our own minds work which is to see… `<incident>`Uh`</incident>`, sort of
purpose and direction in almost anything that we you know our brains are trained to interpret… `<incident>`uh`</incident>`, agency,
basically, in things… `<incident>`uh`</incident>`, even an inanimate thing sometimes, and of course with a a language system,
because language is so fundamental to intelligence, that's going to be easy for us to anthropomorphize that;
I mean, back in the day even the first... `<incident>`uh`</incident>`, you know, the dumbest sort of template chatbots ever, Eliza,
and, and, and, and… the ilk of the original chatbots back in the 60s fooled some people under certain
circumstances, right? they pretended to be a psychologist, so just basically rabbit back to you the same
question you asked it back to you, `<incident>`um`</incident>`… and, uh, some people believe that. So, `<seg type = "idea filosófica de un no filósofo tradicional">` I don't think we can… this is why I think the Turing test is a little bit flawed as a formal test because it depends on the sophistication of the judge, um… whether or not they are qualified to make that distinction; so I think we should… `<incident>`uh `</incident>`, talk to, you know, the the top `<emph>`philosophers`</emph>` about this; people like `<persName type ="DD">`Daniel Dennett`</persName>` and, `<incicent>`uh`</incident>`, `<persName type ="DC">`David Chalmers`</persName>` and others who've obviously thought deeply about consciousness, of course, consciousness itself hasn't been well… there's no agreed definition if I was to, you know, `<incident>`uh`</incident>`… speculate about that, `<incident>`uh, you know`</incident>`… I kind of the definite… the working definition I like is, it's the way information feels when, `<incident>`you know`</incident>`, it gets processed, I think maybe `<persName>`Max Tegmark`</persName>` came up with that… I like that idea, I don't know if it helps us get towards any more operational thing, but… but it's, it's, it's… I think it's a nice way of viewing it, `<incident>`um`</incident>`, I think we can obviously see from neuroscience certain prerequisites that are required, like self-awareness. I think is necessary but not sufficient component; this idea of a self and other, and set of coherent
preferences that are coherent over time, you know, these things are maybe memory, um, these things are
probably needed for a sentient or conscious being, `<incident>`um`</incident>`. But, but the reason that the difficult thing , I think
for us when we get, and I think this is a really interesting philosophical debate, is when we get closer to
`<emph>`AGI`</emph>` and, and, and, `<incident>`you know`</incident>`, and much more powerful systems than we have today, `<incident>`um`</incident>`, how are we going to make this judgment, and one way, which is the `<emph>`Turing test`</emph>` is sort of a behavioral judgment, is… is the system exhibiting all the behaviors, um, that a human sentient, uh, or a sentient being would… would…
would exhibit, `<incident>`um`</incident>`, Is it answering the right questions?, Us it saying the right things?, Is it indistinguishable
from a human?, `<incident>`um`</incident>`, and so on, but I think there's a second thing that makes us as humans regard each other
as sentient, right? Why do we… why do we think this? and I debated this with `<persName type ="DD">`Daniel Dennett`</persName>`, and I think
there's a second reason that's often overlooked, which is that we're running on the same substrate, right? So
if we're exhibiting the same behavior, `<incident>`uh`</incident>`, more or less as humans and we're running on the same, `<incident>`you know`</incident>`,carbon-based biological substrate, the squishy… you know, few pounds of… of flesh in our skulls, then the
most parsimonious, I think, explanation is that you're feeling the same thing as I'm feeling, right? But we
will never have that second part the substrate equivalence with a machine `</seg>` `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

the thing that isn't going to lose to a human ever again in chess. It's not like `<persName type= "ajedrecista">`Kasparov`</persName>` is going to get lucky next week against the best, against, you know, `<emph>`Alpha 0`</emph>` or whatever the best algorithm is at the moment, he's
never going to win again. I mean… that, that, is that I believe that's true in chess and has been true for at
least a few years, it's not going to be like, you know, four games to seven, it's gonna, it's gonna be human
zero until the end of the world, right? See, I don't know, I don't know if love is like chess… I think, uh, the
flaws… no I'm talking about manipulation... manipulation, but I don't know if love, and so the kind of love
we're referring to, if we have a… if we have a robot that can display, credibly display, love and is super
intelligent, and we're not we're again we, this stipulates a few things, but there are a few simple things`</seg>`.  I
mean, we're out of the uncanny valley, right? So, it's like: Yes, you never have a moment where you're
looking at his face and you think: “Oh that didn't quite look right, right this is just problem solved” `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

`<seg type = "Parte 1: (Intro)">`
    `<dur>`min. 00-1:10.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`:The following is a conversation with `<persName type ="DC">`David Chalmers`</persName>`. He's a `<term type = "Filósofo que además es especialista en otra área">`philosopher and cognitive scientist`</term>`, specializing in the areas of `<rs type="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` philosophy of mind philosophy, philosophy of language, and consciousness `</rs>`; he's perhaps best known for formulating `<emph>`the hard problem of consciousness`</emph>`, which could be stated as: `<term type="formulación del problema fuerte de la consciencia">` Why does the feeling, which accompanies awareness of sensory information, exists at all? `</term>`Consciousness is almost entirely mystery, many people who worry about AI safety, and ethics believe that in some form consciousness can and should be engineered into `<emph>`AI`</emph>` systems of the future, so while there's much mystery, disagreement and discoveries yet to be made about consciousness, `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` these conversations while fundamentally philosophical in nature, but may nevertheless be very important for engineers of modern AI systems `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>`.

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (Philosophical zombies and illusion of consciousness)">`
    `<dur>`min. 57:33-1:07:03.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DC`</speaker>`: They're just a `<emph>`thought experiment`</emph>` [the “philosophical zombies”], they may never be
possible… I mean, the extreme case of a zombie is a being which is physically, functionally, behaviorally
identical to me but not conscious; that's a mirror, I don't think that could ever be built in this universe, the
question is just could we… Does that hypothetically make sense?, that's kind of a useful contrast class to
raise questions like: Why aren't we zombies? How does it come about that we're conscious? And we're not
like that, but there were less extreme versions of this like robots, which are maybe not physically identical
to us, maybe not even functionally identical to us, maybe they've got a different architecture, but they can
do a lot of sophisticated things, maybe carry on a conversation, but they're not conscious. That's not so far
out we've got simple computer systemsm these tending in that direction now and presumably this is gonna
get more and more sophisticated over years to come, where we may have some pretty… it's least quite
straightforward to conceive… of some pretty sophisticated robot systems that can use language and be
fairly high functioning without consciousness at all. Then I stipulate that I mean we've cost there's this
tricky question of how you would know whether they're conscious, but let's say we've somehow solved that
and we know that these high-functioning robots aren't conscious then the question is: `<term type= "idea filosófica: Status moral">` Do they have moral status? Does it matter how we treat them?`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`:What does moral status means? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DC`</speaker>`: Basically… for example if we, if I mistreat this glass, this cup, by, uh, by shattering it then that's bad.
Well, why is it bad? That was kind of make a mess, it's gonna be annoying for me, for my partner and so
it's not bad for the cup: no one would say the cup itself has moral status `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>`


`<seg type = "Parte 3: (AGI and Consciousness, existential treats)">`
    `<dur>`min. 1:26:30-1:29:34.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DC`</speaker>`: There's a couple of different kinds of `<emph>`existential threats`</emph>` here: `<seg type="Amenaza existencial a la consciencia">` one is an existential threat to consciousness generally, I mean, yes, I care about humans and the survival of humans and so on, but just say it turns out that that eventually we're replaced by some artificial beings around humans but are somehow
our successes they still have good lives, they still do interesting and wonderful things with the universe: I
don't think that's, that's not so bad, that's just our successors. We were one stage in evolution something
different maybe better came next, if, on the other hand, all of consciousness was wiped out, that would be
a very serious moral disaster, one way that could happen is by all intelligent life being wiped out and many
people think that, yeah, once you get to humans and `<emph>`AI`</emph>` is an amazing sophistication, where everyone has
got the the ability to create weapons that can destroy the whole universe just by… just by pressing a button,
then maybe it's inevitable all intelligent life will… will die out, that would be a… that would certainly be a
disaster, and we've got to think very hard about how to avoid that, but, yeah, another interesting kind of
disaster is that may be intelligent life is not wiped out, but all consciousness is wiped out; so just say you
thought, unlike what I was saying a moment ago, that there are two different kinds of intelligent systems
some which are conscious and some which are some which are not, and just, say, it turns out that we create
`<emph>`AGI`</emph>` with with higher degree of intelligence, meaning higher degree of sophistication and has behavior, but
with no consciousness at all. That AGI could take over the world maybe, but then there be… but let there
be no consciousness in this world, this would be a world of zombies, some people have called this “the
zombie apocalypse”. `</seg>` `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

`<seg type = "Parte 1: (Influence on literature and connection with recent work)">`
    `<dur>`min. 2:45-7:39.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: What books, non-technical, non computer science, would you say had the biggest impact on your life,
either intellectually or emotionally? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`MK`</speaker>`: You've dug deep into my history. I see deep, yeah, I think well my favorite novel is
“Infinite Jest”, by `<persName type="Escritor que estudió filosofía">` David Foster Wallace`</persName>`, which actually, coincidentally, much of it takes place in the halls of buildings right around us here at `<placeName>`MIT`</placeName>`, so that certainly had a big influence on me and, as you noticed, like when I was in high school I actually even started college as an English major, so was very influenced
by sort of badge genre of journalism at the time, and thought I wanted to be a writer and then realized that
an `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >`English major teaches you to read, but it doesn't teach you how to write, and then I became interested in math and computer science instead. `</rs>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: Well, in your new book, “Ethical algorithm”, you kind of sneak up from a algorithmic perspective on
these `<emph>`deep profound philosophical questions of `<term type = "temas filosóficos relacionados con IA">`fairness of privacy`</term>` `</emph>`. In thinking about these topics, How often do you return to that literary mind that either you had? `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`MK`</speaker>`: Yeah, I'd like to claim there was a deeper connection, but… but there, you know, I think both Aaron
and I kind of came at these topics first and foremost from a technical angle; `<seg type="Interdisciplina de la filosofía, relación con otras áreas">` I mean, you know I'm kind of consider myself primarily and originally a machine learning researcher, and I think as we just watched, like the rest of the society, the field technically advanced and then quickly on the heels of that kind of the the
buzzkill of all the antisocial behavior by algorithms, just kind of realized there was an opportunity for us to
do something about it from a research perspective, you know, a more to the point in your question, I mean…
`<emph>`I do have an uncle who is literally a moral philosopher`</emph>` and so in the early days of our technical work on
fairness topics I would occasionally, you know, run ideas behind him, so, I mean, I remembered an early
email I sent to him in which I said like: “Oh, you know here's a specific definition of algorithmic fairness
that we think is some sort of variants of Rawls in fairness, what do you think? And I thought I was asking
a yes-or-no question, and I got back there… kind of classical philosopher’s responsive: “Well, it depends:
if you look at it this way then you might conclude this”… and that's when I realized that there was a real
kind of rift between the ways philosophers and others had thought about things like fairness, you know,
from sort of a humanitarian perspective and the way that you needed to think about it as a `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >`
computer scientist `</rs>` if you were going to kind of implement actual algorithmic solutions `</seg>` `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (Computer scientists should think about ethics)">`
    `<dur>`min. 1:01:25-1:05:59.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: I think `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">`computer scientists `</rs>` should be more philosophically, like should enrich their thinking about these kinds of things. I think it's been too often used as an excuse for roboticists or car vehicles, for example, to not think about the human factor, or `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` psychology`</rs>`, or safety in the same way like computer science design algorithms that be sort of using is an excuse, and I think it's time for basically everybody to become computer scientists `</term>` `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`MK`</speaker>`: I was about to agree with everything you said, except that last point. I think that the other way of
looking at is that I think computer scientists, you know, and and and many of us are, but we need to wait
out into the world more, right? I mean, just the influence that computer science, and therefore computer
scientists, have had on society at large, just like has exponentially magnified in the last 10 or 20 years or
so, and you know…you know, before when we were just thinking tinkering around amongst ourselves and
it didn't matter that much, there was no need for sort of computer scientists to be citizens of the world more
broadly, and I think those days need to be over very very fast, and I'm not saying everybody needs to do it,
but to me like the right way of doing it is to not to sort of think that everybody else is going to become a
computer scientist, but, you know, I think, you know, people are becoming more sophisticated about
computer science even lay people `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`LF`</speaker>`: Yeah. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`MK`</speaker>`:You know, though I think one of the reasons we decided to write this book as we thought 10 years
ago I wouldn't have tried this because I just didn't think that sort of people's awareness of algorithms and

   `<dur>`min. 1:29-5:32.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: `<term type= "Pregunta fundamental para la filosofía práctica">` Why should anyone be interested in philosophy anyway? Why is it important? `</term>` Indeed, what is it exactly? I'm going to put these and other questions to someone who is, himself, of
international reputation: Sir Isaiah Berlin, fellow of all souls college. `<placeName>`Oxford`<placeNameA>` biographer of Karl Marx, and
particularly distinguished for his knowledge of the history of ideas, so Isaiah, what reason, when can one
give to someone for taking an interest in philosophy if he hasn't done so already on his own account, or if
he hasn't been led to it by the education system? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`IB`</speaker>`: Well, `<seg type = "Concepción general de la filosofía">` to begin with these questions are interesting in themselves, but for anyone who doesn't think that, it's possible to point out that what philosophy deals with are the assumptions on
which a great many normal beliefs rest, not sort of things which people like to dig up because people
sometimes don't really want their assumptions examined over much, because if people are uncomfortable
when they're made to look into what really their beliefs rest on, but in fact the sort of assumptions which in
great many ordinary common sense belief rest are matters for philosophical analysis. When looked at, they
turn out to be greatly less secure and greater more complicated than they seem at first, and philosophers,
by examining these, teach people self-knowledge; they explain to them, but very sometimes very in a very
dominating way what they believe and why they believe, it and this is a very central task `</seg>` `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: Where all of us made very `<emph>`uncomfortable`</emph>` by having our assumptions examined, as you just say, by digging into the presuppositions of our own thought, but I think we all, beyond a certain point, resist it.
Why do you think we resist it? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`IB`</speaker>`: Well, of course because people don't like being over analyzed, I suppose, and partly because action
itself, perhaps precludes this kind of thing. `<term type= "Filosofía práctica, la filosofía los problemas cotidianos">`Quite obviously for simply actively engaged in some kind of life, constantly to be asked: Why do you do this? Are you sure, that what the girls which are pursuing are true girls, are you certain that what you are doing is not in some way it doesn't contravene some kind of
moral beliefs which perhaps you want to hold? Or, are you sure that some of your values don't conflict with
certain other values and you're simply not facing that? That sometimes when you're plunged into some kind
of dilemma, you are so frightened of looking in the face, that you avert your gaze and try and get the
responsibility upon some other back, on the back of the state, for example, on the back of your teachers, on
the backyard class, on the back of some other association which will belong`</term>`. Shouldn't you perhaps face
this responsibility? `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

`<seg type = "Parte 1: (Introduction, connection between philosophy and science)">`
   `<dur>`min. 00:00-2:29`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: `<seg type="Interdisciplina de la filosofía, relación con otras áreas">`The connection between philosophy and the `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` mathematical sciences`</rs>` has always been very close. Plato had written over the door of his academy the words, "Let no one enter here who is ignorant of geometry." It was Aristotle who codified the basic sciences into the categories and gave them the names that we use to this day. Some of the greatest philosophers have been themselves great mathematicians, who
invented new branches of mathematics. Descartes is an obvious example, and so is Leibniz and Pascal.
In fact, most of the great philosophers, not all but most, came to philosophy from mathematics or the
sciences. And this tendency is continued into our present century.
Bertrand Russell was trained first as a mathematician, `<persName type ="filósofo mencionado previamente en el corpus">`Wittgenstein`</persName>` was trained first as an engineer. The reason for this persisting connection is, I think, obvious. And that is that the basic urge, which has driven most of the greatest philosophers, has been the urge to deepen our understanding of the world and of its
structure. And this is also what creative scientists are doing. For most of the past, too, people thought
that mathematics was the most indubitable knowledge, as well as being utterly precise and clear,
that human beings possessed. So there have always been plenty of philosophers examining mathematics
to try and find out what was so special about it, and whether this was something that could be applied to
the acquisition of other sorts of knowledge.
Ditto with the `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía" >`sciences`</rs>`, which were also thought to yield a very specially safe, and certain kind of knowledge.What was it about science that made its results so reliable?, people asked themselves. And
could its methods, whatever these were, be used in other fields? These investigations into the concepts,
and methods, and procedures, and models that are involved in mathematics and in science have come to
be known as the philosophy of mathematics, and the philosophy of science`</seg>`. And it's with these that we're
going to be concerned in this program. `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (What philosophers of science do, and computers sophistication)">`
   `<dur>`min. 25:10-35:09`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: You are a philosopher of science. `<term type = "pregunta importante">` What do you and your colleagues do?`</term>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: `<seg type = "Concepción general de la filosofía">` Well, part of what we do, which I won't try to describe on this broadcast, is technical investigation of specific scientific theories. We look at `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` quantum mechanics very closely, both on learn what lessons we can learn from it for philosophy and to see what contributions we can make
as philosophers to clarifying its foundations. We look at relativity theory very closely. We look at
Darwinian evolution very closely, and so on`</rs>`. This is the part of `<emph>`philosophy of science`</emph>`. which provides the data for the rest. But much philosophy of sciences shades over into general philosophy. And I think that the best way to describe it is in terms of
what we've been talking about. That is, each of the issues we've been talking about, divides philosophers
of science. There are philosophers of science who have a correspondence view of truth and try to show that
this can be made precise, that the objections can be overcome, you can still view science, somehow, in the
old way. And there are others who try to sketch what another view of truth would come to. There are
philosophers who still think there is an inductive method that can be rigorously stated and who work on
inductive logic. And by the way, I think it's important there should be, because we won't make progress to
trying to state the inductive method if there aren't. And that there are others who view the development of
science more culturally, more historically, and then people like myself who are have a sort of inbetween
position, that there's something to the notion of a scientific method, there are clear examples, but
that it's more or less a continuum. You mustn't think of it as a kind of mechanical rule, an `<emph>`algorithm`</emph>`, that
you can apply to get scientific knowledge. So that I'd say each of these issues -- the nature of truth, the
nature of the scientific method--, whether there's any necessary truth in science, any conceptual
contribution which is permanent and can't be subject to revision is a big question `</seg>` `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: And `<term type="preunta importante">` who are you, plural, doing all this work for?`</term>` I don't ask that in an irreverent way, but what I have in mind is this: I've myself taken part in attempts to bring scientists and philosophers together for
discussions of precisely the issues that you've raised. And these attempts have usually failed and failed to
the same reason, namely, that the scientists lose interest. They go back to their laboratories and get on with
doing more science. And the great bulk of scientists, it seems to me, don't, in fact, take very much of an
interest in the issues that you've been talking about. I think it's conspicuous that the greatest of all scientists
are exceptions. I mean, the really block-busting, the path-breaking scientists who've actually made the
revolution in this century that you've been talking about --people like `<persName type= "científicos que también eran filósofos en su porpio derecho">`Einstein, Max Planck, Neils Bohr, Max Born, Schrodinger, de Broglie`</persName>`--these people, were enormously interested in the conceptual questions that's you've raised. But these were the pioneering geniuses. And the great mass of thousands of scientists,
who follow on behind them and put their work to its practical application, they don't seem to care so: Who
is listening to you? Who is reading the stuff that you publish? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: Well, I'd say, first of all, I think we are basically writing for the philosophically-interested layman,
for the reader of philosophy. I don't view philosophy of science as giving direct advice to scientists, just as
I think more philosophers are ill-advised to think that they're giving, at least, immediately current
contemporary advice on how to live your life or what bills to pass in parliament. On the other hand, I do
think it's scientists tend to know the philosophy of science of 50 years ago. And perhaps this isn't a
bad thing. That is, perhaps this time lag, this culture lag, has some value in weeding out what they shouldn't
pay attention to. `<term type= "idea importante: los científicos deben escuchar a los filósofos">`It's annoying to a philosopher to encounter a scientist who's both sure that he needn't listen to any philosophy of science, and then who produces verbatim ideas which you can recognize as
coming from what was popular in 1928`</term>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: Is there a direct parallel here between what you're saying about scientists and the `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` economist Keynes' famous remark that nearly all businessman who thought they were indifferent to airy-fairy economic theory were in fact the slaves of the economic theorists of yesterday, of a previous generation?`</rs>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: That's exactly true. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: I suppose another parallel one could make would be to say that the account that ordinary languageusers
give of language, and their use of language, would be extremely unsophisticated simply because they
take it for granted and have never thought about it. That too would probably apply to the account that most
scientists would give of what they were doing when they were doing their science `</u>`.
`<u>` `<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: That's right. That is, it's a mistake to think that merely because one practices an activity, one can give
a theory of it. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: One criticism that's often been made about philosophers of science is that although they talk of science
in this general way, what they're nearly always referring to, in fact, is one science, namely physics. Now,
it's true, isn't it?, that the science in which the most exciting developments have probably taken place in
the last 20 years, anyway, has been not physics but biology. Are philosophers of science open, genuinely
open, to the criticism of being too physics-based in their view of science and having ignored biology too
much? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: `<link target="pregunta pesasa" type="respuesta">`I think I would defend us against that on the grounds that I don't-- although the theories in biology are of great scientific importance--Darwin's theory of evolution, `<persName type= "científicos que tambiérn eran filósofos en su propio derecho">`Crick/Watson`</persName>` on DNA, and so on, they don't, by and large, pose big methodological problems of a kind of don't arise in physical science. I mean, I'm not sure whether you're going to agree with that. `</link>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: Well, I mean, you mentioned evolution just now. And it seems to me that here is a concept which
originated in one of the sciences, namely biology, and which, over a comparatively short period of time,
has spread throughout the whole of our culture. So the way almost everybody think is influenced by the
notion of evolution. Not only about the origins of man but about institutions, or the arts, all kinds of other
things. I mean, evolution has become a dimension of Western man's thinking about almost anything. Is that
not so? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: That's right, and perhaps there has not been enough attention to this theory. Though what strikes me as
interesting is that the possibility of explanations of… what we think of as the biological kind --explanations
in terms of function, rather than in terms of physics and chemistry, what you're made of-- have come under
more attention, recently, as a result of computer science. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`BM`</speaker>`: Now, this does raise something I'm particularly interested in: when you talk of `<emph type="Tema recurrente del corpus: Inteligencia Artificial (IA)">` computer Science, and that is the interaction between our technology, in the case of computers, and philosophy. Not just science and philosophy, but technology and philosophy. I mean, computers were originally constructed on
the basis of a self-conscious analogy with the human mind`</emph>`. But as they became more and more
sophisticated we began to learn things from them about the human mind. So our construction of computers
and what they, then, tell us about ourselves seems to actually proceed by interactive growth. Isn't that so? `</u>`
`<u>``<speaker>`HP`</speaker>`: `<seg type="Interdisciplina de la filosofía, relación con otras áreas">` That's right, and today this is one are, by the way, in which philosophers are in close contact with scientists. That is, the fields of `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` linguistics, cognitive psychology, computer science, philosophy of language, today interact constantly`</rs>`. People send papers to one another -- not because someone tells them to. There are conferences at which specialists needs to meet together -- again, not because
someone decided there should be some cross-fertilization. The interesting thing about the computer case,
if I can stick with it for a moment, is, one might have thought, that the rise of the computer would
encourage a certain kind of vulgar materialism. That is, "so, after all, we are machines. So, after all,
everything about us can be explained in terms of `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` physics and chemistry." Paradoxically, the real effect of the computer on psychology and on philosophy of mind `</rs>` has been a decrease in that kind of
reductionism.`</seg>`
See, the thing about the `<emph>`computer`</emph>` is that when you work with computers you very rarely have to think
about their physics and chemistry.There's a distinction that people draw between their software --meaning
their program, their instructions, their rules, the way they do things-- and their hardware. And generally,
you ignore their hardware. You talk about computers at the software level. And you wouldn't really be able
to explain what they do, in a way that would be if any use to anyone, in terms at the hardware level. There
is a kind of emergence here, although it's not a mystical kind of emergence, it's not that they're violating
the laws of physics. It's just that the level of organization, that higher-level facts about organization have a
kind of autonomy. You'd say this, the fact that it's following this program explains why does this, and I
don't need to know how it's built. I only need to know it can be built in such a way that will follow this
program. If you apply this to the mind, it suggests a return to view of mind that I associate with Aristotle.
It's the view that we are not ghosts in a machine, not spirits which only temporarily in bodies, but that the
relation between the mind in the body is a relation of function to what has that function. `</u>` `</seg>`

   `<dur>`min.11: 30-14:38.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: I’d better talk to a skeptical philosopher: `<persName type ="DD">`Daniel Dennett`</persName>` is my
man. Professor at `<placeName type = "Universidad">`Tufts University`</placeName>` and author of “Consciousness: explained”, explained? Can Dan defend his ambitious claim? I go to Cambridge, Massachusetts to find out.
Dan, I, like you, have been fascinated with consciousness my whole life it seems like it's a window on some
bigger reality beyond us. You've talked about consciousness as something that we feel that's really more
marvelous than it really is. Why is that? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DD`</speaker>`: Yes, I think that `<emph type = "tema recurrente">`consciousness`</emph>` plays tricks on us… it seems to us as if here we are inside, somewhere behind the eyes, and in between the ears, and the inner witnesses watching this
wonderful show, and it's it's all in color, and it's complete in some wonderful sense; but then when you do
the the the physiology and you study perception you realize that no, in fact, you have a very limited take:
you're only taking sips from that fire hose of information that's coming in a little bit from vision a little bit
from, from hearing and there's in fact this, this… competition going on, tug of war between different senses,
between different interpretations of what you're seeing, and all of this competition resolves itself in the
fullness of time, and pretty darn quick…uh, to produce the the behavior that we're capable of, and the
reflection that we're capable of. It seems, though, as if there's… it all comes together at some place for, for
enjoyment, in the middle, and that's just an illusion; there's no place in the brain where it all comes together
for enjoyment and for witnessing, by an inner witness. So we have to take all that work that that inner
witness was going to do, and we have to break it up in little bits, and distribute around in the brain in the
time and space that's available, and no one of those little bits is going to be conscious and yet the sum of
all of that work that the inner witness was going to do; we have that illusion, and it is an illusion because
in fact there's lots of things going on at once they're not all that coherent and so our brains are very good at
creating the sorts of simplifications that make that make its own job and easier;so, yes consciousness is an
illusion of the brain, for the brain, by the brain if you like. `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (David Chalmers)">`
   `<dur>` min. 14:45-18.53`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: If Dan is right, and consciousness is an illusion, all of me is in my head, all of me is just my brain
crammed into my cranium and when it goes, I go [Music].
`<persName type ="DC">`David Chalmers`</persName>`, an australian philosopher, suggests that consciousness may be irreducible and not
explainable by brain alone; he calls consciousness “the hard problem”, why hard? I've waited until Dave
comes to California.
Dave, I've always been fascinated by the concept of existence, and when I think about existence, what that
means, I'm always back to consciousness, but then i see some philosophers telling me that consciousness is
an illusion, doesn't really exist. You think otherwise? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DC`</speaker>`:  `<link target="Parte 1: (Daniel Dennett)" type="Opinión de DC">` I think `<emph type = "tema recurrente">`consciousness`</emph>` is the thing we know about more directly than we know about anything in the world. You know, the great philosopher Descartes said we can doubt the existence of anything in the world, I could doubt that you exist: maybe this is just a dream but the one thing I can't doubt is that i'm conscious right now. I think I am conscious, therefore I am.
My consciousness is presented to me more directly than anything else in the world; if this is an illusion,
then the illusion is consciousness `</link>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: Some say: okay, that's Descartes, they ridiculed him, they said now that we know about the brain, we
know how the neurons, work the spites of activity, the synapses, the chemical compositions, the `<emph>`complexity`</emph>`;
that out of that complexity of hundred billion neurons and trillions of connections, consciousness can
emerge. Still an illusion `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`DC`</speaker>`: `<term type= "cambio de punto de vista filosófico">` Maybe consciousness emerges from something else. I mean this is a further question downstream, but the number one datum of the science of consciousness, and the philosophy of consciousness, is there is consciousness. Is it the first element of reality, or is it something derivative? Is it sort of a second element
of reality that somehow emerges from the brain? Well, that's an open question, at least, but you can't
question that consciousness exists. I tell you what: I can question your consciousness, I can't be 100%
certain that you are conscious right now, maybe you're just like acting conscious and walking, you're
walking the walk, you're talking the talk, maybe nothing's going on in there, maybe you're a zombie… I
can't question my consciousness, I'm experienced, I'm experiencing it directly: it's more real to me than
anything else. `</term>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: Tell me about `<emph>`zombies`</emph>`, it's a funny word, but there's some significance in there? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DC`</speaker>`: Well, `<term type = "idea filosófica">`the zombies that philosophers are concerned with, they're just like you and me, but they lack consciousness, they walk around, acting like a conscious being, talking like a conscious being but they're
not conscious. You stick with the pin. They say: “Oh, exactly”, and you ask them: “Are you conscious?
They say “yes”, and no one thinks zombies exist. I'm not a zombie, I don't think you're a zombie, but we
can at least make sense of the idea… this, they seem to at least be imaginable, our world is not a world of
zombies: we're not robots, we're not automata; we're conscious that itself is something that needs
explanation, there's a lot of things we want to explain when we explain consciousness. `</term>` `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 3: (John Searle)">`
   `<dur>` min. 18:55-22:41`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: [Music] `<persName type = "JS">` John Searle`</persName>`, a leading philosopher who rejects such speculation and he has challenged `<persName type="DC">`Chalmers `</persName>` on whether `<emph>`consciousness`</emph>` goes beyond the brain and debated it about whether consciousness is an illusion. I'll go anywhere to speak with John, graciously he invites me to his home in Berkeley.
John, consciousness seems like the most obvious thing in the world we all know, what it is we all have it
but, Why is it so mysterious? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`JS`</speaker>`: `<link target="Opinión de DC" type="Opinión de JS">` Well, there are several reasons, I guess, the most important is that we have a certain conception of reality that's largely derived from the progress of the sciences over the past three centuries, and we think that ultimately reality must be material, and then we find: “my gosh we're all conscious, we
all have this inner qualitative subjective stuff”, and that seems mysterious and then another thing that makes
it seem mysterious is we have this a terrific religious philosophical tradition that says reality divides into
two: there's the mind and the body, there's the soul and the flesh, and this makes it seem like mother must
be these two different realms and then we've got another hassle.`</link>` `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

`<u>` `<speaker>`DD`</speaker>`:If you go back and look at Descartes, Rene Descartes, who was the... the really, the father of dualism;
he did a very interesting thing: he said first of all only human beings had mines animals didn't have mines,
they were just fancy clockwork, and we're a lot of fancy clockwork too. There's lots of just mechanical
processes going on in our body, but then in addition to those fancy processes, there's… there's a special,
and even to him, mysterious link to an immaterial mind; in fact, the only thing that he said couldn't be
explained mechanically, is what we're doing right now: having an intelligent conversation. It was language
and the capacity to have an intelligent conversation that he underlined as the thing that was beyond all
imaginable mechanism that's what you needed an immaterial bit of wonder stuff what he realized and has
since been confirmed by `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` linguistics`</rs>`. If there was ever any doubt is that there's as good as an infinity of sentences that you and I can effortlessly understand, he didn't see how anything mechanical could do that

   `<dur>`min. 2:05-6:36.`</dur>`

`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: `<persName type= "científico y filósofo futurista">`Freeman Dyson`</persName>` is one of the world's most innovative thinkers: `<emph>` physicist, philosopher, visionary`</emph>`. The
far far future is Dyson territory. We meet at the `<placeName type = "Universidad">`Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton`</placeName>`. I asked Freeman to categorize the far far future. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`FD`</speaker>`: `<seg type = "Visión de FD sobre el futuro, interdisciplina de la visión">` I make a distinction between sort of four futures: the first, the future of the solar system, which is say 1000 years when humans will bring the solar system to life and and so we are morally spread over the solar system; a million years it will take roughly to spread over the galaxy; a billion
years would be roughly how long it will take for life to spread over the universe. I mean, give or take a
factor of 10; and then the fourth future is that after the present universe has passed away, when the stars are
faded, when things are getting colder and colder and less and less is happening, when essentially all that's
left is a few black holes a few lumps of iron which used to be planets, and the remnants of stars and perhaps
some very dilute plasma, and that's it. And the question is: Can life adapt to that kind of an environment? I
think it could. The best way to look at this, I think is through science fiction; one of the best is the “Black
Cloud”, which is a book of Fred Hoyle, who was a famous astronomer and also a good writer of fiction and
the “Black Cloud” is a story about a form of life which is simply a cloud of dust grains, which floats around
through space and the dust grains are in communication through electric and magnetic fields. So, instead
of nerves, and muscles, and brain it just has patterns of electric and magnetic fields; it's not dependent on
liquid water for its functioning so these dust grains could be essentially at zero temperature, so as the
temperature gets colder and colder, the cloud has to expand gradually and grow a little bit larger, so that
the fields become weaker, but they still could perform mental functions and carry information and memory`</seg>` `</u>`. 
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: So, what would that mean for the temporal structure of a thought?`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`FD`</speaker>`: `<term type = "Idea filosófica similar a la de DC sobre la amenza existebcial contra la consciencia">`Thoughts would have to slow down as as the temperature falls and as the cloud expands, each thought
would probably be something like the time it takes for electromagnetic signals to travel from one side of
the cloud to the other, so it might be seconds, it might be hours, it might be years, because the creature has
infinite time, so it doesn't mind being slow from point of view of the creature. I mean, a thousand years are
just but as yesterday`</term>`. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: That sounds almost `<emph>`biblical`</emph>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`FD`</speaker>`: So, the unit of time is set by the creature's own `<emph>`consciousness`</emph>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: Is it conceivable that it could go forever? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`FD`</speaker>`:It's conceivable. The question whether the universe expands exponentially, of course, is very important;
if it is a linear expansion with the universe just continuing to expand as we observe it now, then life can in
principle continue forever; if the expansion is exponential, then we can't, then that's bad news for life. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`:To understand the far far future, consider two categories: the first is measured in thousands, millions
and billions of years, and the question is: `<term type = "Pregunta importante">` What will intelligence be or do?`</term>` The second goes out multiple trillions of years, after the stars burn out, and the question is: Can intelligence survive? Freeman claims that
if the universe expands linearly then life could survive indefinitely [Music].`</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

`<seg type = "Parte 1: (Intro)">`
   `<dur>`min.0:25-1:20.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: I love science because science accesses truths. `<seg type="Interdisciplina de la filosofía, relación con otras áreas">` To me, trained in science, it seems obvious that science is external, objective and absolute. But some disagree, claiming that science is internal, subjective and relative. Moreover, can science address all questions? Or are there limits to science? What is science,
anyway?Science itself. An idea? A process? A way of thinking? How to get at the essence of science?
Discern how science really works. How science should work. All of this is called "philosophy of science".
But should science care about philosophy? Should science value philosophy? `</seg>` I'm Robert Lawrence Kuhn
and Closer To Truth is my journey to find out. `</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 2: (John Hawthorne, the philosophy of science, Imp.)">`
   `<dur>`min. 5:22-7:11`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: (…) Science can describe what things happen but cannot explain what things are.
It's like a kind of "universal limit", like the speed of light --the human mind can find regularities in nature,
but not penetrate the foundations of reality. But, most scientists do not bother themselves with philosophy.
And some openly dismiss it as "irrelevant, if not obstructive". I've found a fondness for putting to these
dismissive attitudes of scientists. It's a good conversation starter. More important, it probes 'philosophy of
science'. Historically, hasn't philosophy prepared the way for science? An `<placeName type= "Universidad">`Oxford `</placeName>` professor of metaphysics thinks so. I meet John Hawthorne.
John, `<incident type = "Misma pregunta">` some of my scientist friends would say philosophers have a great value in the world and that is when
they keep other philosophers away from bothering scientists. What do you say? </incident> </u> 
`<u>` `<speaker>`JH`</speaker>`:`<seg type = "Concepción general de la filosofía">` One thing that they should remember is that philosophers historically have had a huge role in the development of science. In fact, `<emph>`it's only a recent thing that people clearly self-identified
as philosophers rather than scientists`</emph>`, or scientists rather than philosophers. `<rs ref="personas que están entre la ciencia y la filosofía">` Aristotle, Descartes, Leibniz, Newton `</rs>`, and many others, recognizably did stuff that was both science and philosophy and there was no clear divide between them. So, I think it's a very strange thought to be having: that philosophy is useless,
because there's no sharp divide historically between philosophy and science `</seg>`anyway`</u>` `</seg>`

`<seg type = "Parte 3: (Rebeca Goldstein: How does philosophy work?)">`
   `<dur>`min. 10:07-15:12`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: John argues that philosophy benefits science by clarifying ways of thinking -how issues are described,
how evidence is considered, how theories are structured. But, how does all this wonderful stuff happen?
How does philosophy work its putative "magic"? I hear that several of my favorite philosophers are
attending a conference on consciousness. So, I go to Tucson, Arizona, to see how they react when some
scientists attack most philosophers. I meet a philosopher of mind who considers philosophy's impact on the
world: `<persName>`Rebecca Newberger Goldstein`</persName>`.
`<incident type = "Misma pregunta">` Rebecca, it seems that many scientists today have taken a special interest in attacking philosophy as not
only worthless, but debilitating to doing good science under the theory that philosophy was and is prescientific,
that it was fine when we didn't have science, but now that we do have science, it gets in the way. `</incident>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RG`</speaker>`: Yes, and there's a lot in the history of science and the history of philosophy
to support that view. If you look at it very superficially, I would say. Of course, `<term type = "Relación de la ciencia con la filosofía">`all science began as philosophy`</termz>`. `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` The word science didn't even come into existence until the 19th century was called natural philosophy and that covered `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">`physics and it covered cosmology`</rs>` and, as science makes progress, the sphere of philosophy shrinks. There is no doubt about that. So, the questions that have been philosophical sometimes are proto scientific questions and it's simply a matter of science to develop the techniques, the methodology so that it can turn them into empirical questions and then make progress. So, that's generally
the argument and then say, you know the terminus of this ongoing problem is that any set of philosophical
problems will go to the null set. Well, here's why that won't work, I would say: First of all, you need quite
sophisticated philosophy to make that argument. `<term type = "idea filosófica">`You need a way of demarcating science, for example,
from other explanations. Who was the person to whom all scientists turn when they want to make that
demarcation between a scientific theory and an unscientific theory? `<persName type = "filósofo de la ciencia">`Karl Popper`</persName>`, right. Falsifiability`</term>`. Who Was Karl Popper? He was a `<emph>`philosopher and he made the argument philosophically. So, you know, to help yourself, to philosophical conclusions`</emph>` in order to argue that, you know, philosophy is not necessary, is
just… it's not kosher. The other thing, of course, is, you know, to say that science is discovering the nature
of reality. And, you know, we don't need philosophy. Once again, to make the claim for scientific realism
depends on very, very sophisticated work that has to be done in philosophy of science.
(…) First of all, don't understand [today’s scientists] that philosophy does other things than trying to
describe reality. I do believe that is the sphere of science. Science is this wonderful technique that we've
worked out that acknowledges how wrong we get everything and gives reality a chance to answer us back
when we're getting it wrong. And I think that's what we have to depend on in order to understand reality.
Philosophy has other uses. For example, what I just said. That was pure philosophy. Right. Science can't
give you that interpretation of science. That was philosophy, so that's my answer `</term>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: `<link target="postura de RG" type="x">` Rebecca offers a robust defense of philosophy - science cannot escape philosophy's power, she argues - and shouldn't seek to - because philosophy makes science make sense. But to most philosophers,
facilitating the theory and practice of science, while useful, hardly represents the deep value of philosophy `</link>` `</u>` `</seg>`.


`<seg type = "Parte 4: (Value of philosophy: John Searle. Imp: last minute)">`
   `<dur>`min.15:13-18:06`</dur>`

v<u>` `<speaker>`JS`</speaker>`: A philosophical question is what's the nature of causation. And, of course, that
question is in part addressed by thinking how causes work in the sciences. So, we have had to alter our
conception of causation by discoveries in physics. `<emph>`There's a constant interplay between philosophy and
science and indeed the very greatest scientists, like `<persName type = "Científicos que también eran filósofos en su propio derecho">`Einstein or Newton`</persName>`, are philosophers. And both of them thought of themselves as philosophers`</emph>`. But, some scientists say that just that kind of question, what is causation, science has usurped philosophy and philosophy was doing all sorts of things that really weren't
addressing the question, coming up with dead ends and paradoxes, and science is getting down to the facts
and how it works, and now they know causes and some are Newtonian and some are quantum mechanical...
But, the problem is that they don't make it look as if all of this is already established. `</u>` `</seg>`


`<seg type = "Parte 5: (Value of philosophy, Daniel Dennett and conclusions, IMP.)">`
   `<dur>`min. 20:49-26:00.`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: To John, the profound value of philosophy is posing fundamental questions. Philosophy is the best
way - perhaps the only way, he says -for finding the foundations of things. But if so, why then do many
scientists dismiss or ignore philosophy? I love probing this point - and I do so with a no-nonsense
philosopher known for exposing wooly thinking and expanding hard-core science `<persName type = "DD">`Daniel Dennett`</persName>`.
`<incident type = "Misma pregunta">` Dan, philosophy is under attack. One prominent scientist told me that there is value in good philosophers,
but that only value is to keep the bad philosophers off my back. (laughs)`</incident>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DD`</speaker>`: I have some sympathy for that view. 'Cause it seems to me that I spend a lot
of my time doing pretty much that, or trying to. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: So, scientists would think you're a good philosopher because you keep all the bad ones from annoying
too many scientists, but if none of you existed at all, so much the better.`</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DD`</speaker>`: Well, `<seg type = "Concepción general de la filosofía">` I think there's a good positive role for philosophers. What philosophers are good at is clarifying questions. At their best, that's what they're doing. `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` And in any area where you're not quite sure what the right questions are, whether you're asking the right questions, that's where --what you're doing is philosophy whether you like it or not `</term>`. And the reason that a trained philosopher can help with that is that we know the history of all the tempting bad answers. `<term type= "la filosofía es fundamental para las demás áreas">` It is really fascinating and even entertaining to watch really brilliant scientists start thinking about tough issues, and reinventing all the mistakes over the history of philosophy. Why are they reinventing them? Because these are very tempting mistakes.`</term>` And if you don't know the history of what's wrong with `<persName type = "Previamente mencionado">`Hume`</persName>` and Kant and Aristotle and Plato and all the rest, then you're going to fall into those mistakes. Burn their fingers like a few times like and then they begin to realize that there is
a role for philosophy. Because they don't know for sure if they're asking the right questions. `</seg>``</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: What's an example of that? `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`DD`</speaker>`: Let's look at `<emph type = "tema recurrente">`consciousness`</emph>`. So many people when they start thinking about consciousness are basically thinking, as I like to say, about the show that's going in people's heads and how you account for that. But,
they get off on the wrong foot if they think it's obvious that that's what's going on. `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` It takes some heavy lifting, philosophical lifting to show them that there are alternative questions which really get at what they're interested in, which don't presuppose that there's a place where the show goes on. And if you think there's
a place where the show goes on, then you're postponing the serious work. You're only doing half the job.
Sometimes I ask people in this position, I say, what's the product of apple trees? And they say, apples. I
say, no, apple trees are the product of apple trees. Apples are an intermediate product. Consciousness is not
the end of the line; it's an intermediate product, and the ultimate product is intelligent, apt, guided behavior;
sensitively guided behavior in the world. Until you answer that part of the issue, until your theory handles
how the experiences are consumed, how they're used, how they modulate your behavior, you don't have a
theory of consciousness. So, about half the people in the field simply stop short. They don't even try to do
anything but the first half of the theory of consciousness. And that's a mistake, and it's a philosophical
mistake `</term>` `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: Yes, `<emph>`philosophy is indeed a progenitor of science`</emph>` - but we do not worship our ancestors, and so, that history, to me, has marginal meaning. I want to know, today, should science value philosophy? Sure, but
only if philosophy benefits science! `<seg type = "Valor general de la filosofía">` Here are five possible benefits: 1. Philosophy clarifies the kinds of questions science asks - enabing answers that are more precise. 2. Philosophy expands the kinds of
questions science can ask - enlarging the scope of problems that science can solve. 3. Philosophy enhances
experimental design and the robustness of evidence – strengthening the scientific method. 4. Philosophy
defines the boundaries between science and pseudo-science, marking certain fields or claims as unscientific.
5. Philosophy sets the limits of science, distinguishing science from non-science. Take the
relationship between science and morality - or between science and art. With neuroscience blurring
boundaries, careful philosophical analysis is vital `</seg>`. Though science is king, philosophy can 'steady the
crown', keeping science... closer to truth. `</u>` `</seg>` `</div2>`

`<seg type = "Parte 1: (Scott Aaronson, IMPORTANT)">`
   `<dur>`min. 17:19-21:35`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: So, why won't some scientists "waste their time"? `<term type = "pregunta importante">` And why do some philosophers feel unappreciated? `</term>` Is `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">` neuroscience a new term in the philosophy-science equation? Can neuroscience mediate? `</rs>` Catalyze harmony? `<term type="la filosofía es fundamental para las demás áreas">` Some scientists expect that neuroscience will reduce all philosophical issues to neural events in the brain`</term>`. `<term type= "Interdisciplina de la filosofía: conexión con otras áreas">` Some philosophers expect that when neuroscience fails to explain consciousness, the failure will reaffirm the relevance of philosophy`</term>`. But in the end, `<term type = "Pregunta importante">` do scientists need philosophers?`</term>` I meet an `<placeName type = "Universidad">`MIT`</placeName>` professor working on the frontiers of computational complexity and quantum computers - Scott Aaronson.
`<emph>`One could be forgiven for calling Scott a kind of philosopher`</emph>`. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`SA`</speaker>`:  `<term type = "idea filosófica de un no filósofo tradicional">` The world needs good philosophers, if for no other reason than to refute the bad philosophers`</term>`. Right? It's the same reason why we need soldiers, we need lawyers. Even in the age of
science, you know, philosophy does play a very important role in helping to clarify concepts. I go ever year
or two to meetings where I talk to professional philosophers and I find that they're, you know, often they
actually listen to you much more carefully than your fellow scientists do. They're really good at spotting
imprecision in language or unstated assumptions, things of that kind. Now, at the same time, I also think
it's true that the critique of philosophy is that, you know, it doesn't really make progress. Right, it just goes
around in circles. You know, and that does have some truth to it. But, I think that there is a sort of
philosophical progress, which is possible, and which is wonderful when it happens and this is that we can
often sort of identify some aspect of a `<emph>`philosophical question`</emph>` that can actually be addressed using math or
using science, and then we can just sort of break it off. And then we can tackle that. Okay, and then of
course, you know, people will say, but you've just replaced the real mystery by this other question that you
can answer. You know, and you say, okay, fine, we should admit that that's what we're doing. You know,
we're using philosophy as an inspiration for science questions but, you know, now we can keep returning
to the philosophical question and we can find, okay, maybe, you know, we can find a new scientific question
that captures some new aspect of the philosophical question that was, you know, that hadn't been touched
before. And, you know, and in this way we can actually make progress. So, you know, to give a few - there
are many questions that people would once have called philosophical, like is nature determined or random?
Right now, you know, we have quantum mechanics that can say a lot about that. What is the nature of
mathematical knowledge? Right, you know, since the time of `<persName type = "Filosófo, lógico y matemático">` Gödel`</persName>`, Gödel's `<q type ="Obra citada">`incompleteness theorem`</q>`, we have learned that `<rs ref="áreas en conexión con la filosofía">`mathematics itself `</rs>` can say a tremendous amount about that question.You know, or like, what are infinitesimals? Right, can you have something, you know, can you have something that's smaller than any positive number, but greater than zero? Right or, you know, when you drop a ball, you know, is it
moving at the very instant when you drop it? Okay, at least if we've taken a calculus course, right, we hope
we no longer get confused about that sort of thing. That was, you know, hugely confusing to the ancient
Greek philosophers. `<seg type = "Concepción general de la filosofía">` This is the closest thing to philosophical progress that I can see: People taking the ancient mysteries of philosophy and not quite solving them, but taking an aspect of them that, you know,
captures part of what people want to know about, and then addressing it using the tools of math and science `</seg>`. `</u>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: `<term type = "Resumen de la postura de SA">` Scott sees the problems with philosophy - especially its lack of progress. But he also recognizes three benefits: Philosophers listen carefully. They spot imprecisions. They uncover hidden assumptions. I'd like there to be more `</term>`. `</u>` `</seg>`


`<seg type = "Parte 2: (Conclusions)">`
   `<dur>`min. 24:45-25:59`</dur>`
`<u>` `<speaker>`RLK`</speaker>`: "Skeptical" is the right place to start. Does appreciating the "meaning of science" require "philosophy
of science"? `<seg type = "Posibles apliciones de la filosofía a la ciencia">`There are two applications here. The first applies philosophy to science - exploring the nature of science and the scientific process - including the careful examination of questions and methods. Science
can discern regularities, making exquisitely accurate predictions. But, `<term type = "Pregunta importante">`can science reveal bedrock reality? `</term>`The second application applies science to philosophy, addressing with science the big questions raised by
philosophy. For example: What is time? Does it flow? What are laws of nature? Can they change? How
can mind come from brain? Will philosophy continue to wither`</seg>`... becoming a handmaiden of science? Or
can philosophy regain its high perch as a fundamental probe of reality? The ultimate arbiter, I suspect, may
be `<emph type = "Tema recurrente">` consciousness`</emph>` -in getting... closer to truth. `</u>` `</seg>`
